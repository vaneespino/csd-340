"The Nightmare Before Christmas" best quotes:

<p>Sally: [sings] I sense there's something in the wind 
That feels like tragedy's at hand.
 And though I'd like to stand by him, 
 Can't shake this feeling that we have.
 The worst is just around the bend.
 And does he notice 
 My feelings for him? 
 And will he see
 How much he means to me?
 I think it's not to be.
</p>
 
<p>Jack Skellington: [singing] I'm a master of fright,
and a deeeemon of light,
and I'll scare you right out of your pants.
To a guy in Kentucky
I'm Mister Unlucky 
And I'm know thoughout England and France,
And since I am dead,
I can take off my head
[does it]
Jack Skellington: to recite Shakespearean quotations.
No animal or man
[puts it back on]
Jack Skellington: Can SCREAM like I can
With the fury of my ree-cii-ta-tions.
</p>

<p>Oogie Boogie Man: Well well well. What have we here? Sandy Claws, huh? Ooo I'm really scared!
So you're the one everybody's talking about?
[laughs]
Oogie Boogie Man: [singing] You're joking, you're joking
I can't believe my eyes
You're joking me, you've gotta be
This can't be the right guy! He's ancient, he's ugly
I don't know which is worse! I might just spit a seam now if I don't die laughing first!
