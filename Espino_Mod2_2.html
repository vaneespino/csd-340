</p>
<p> My name is Vanessa Espino. I am was born and raised in Georgia. <span style="class"> I am 27 years old.</span></p>
<p> I am the daughter of two parents that cmae to America to build a better life for their kids. Once I graduate,
I will be the first in my family to graduate college. This will be a huge accomplishment for myself, as well as my family.</p>
<p> In my spare time, I love to spend time with my two dogs, Ruka and Loki. I also love to read and watch anime. I love to
spend time at home gardening, or reading rather than going out. Definetly a home body.</p>
<p> I am excited to use what I learn in my classes, to start a new career. I want to build a better life for myself
and my family. I'm excited to keep learning to create a better future.</p>
